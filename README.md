## Introduction

The Hangman Game is a classic word-guessing game where players try to guess a hidden word one letter at a time. It's a fun and challenging game that tests your vocabulary and word-guessing skills. This version of the game is designed to be played in a web browser and is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- Randomly selects a word from a predefined list.
- Provides a hint for the selected word.
- Keeps track of incorrect guesses.
- Displays a visual representation of the hangman as incorrect guesses accumulate.
- Allows players to guess letters using an on-screen keyboard.
- Notifies the player when they win or lose the game.
- Offers the option to play the game again with a new word.

## How to Play

1. When you start the game, a random word from the word list will be selected, and a hint related to that word will be displayed.

2. The word is represented by a series of blank spaces, with each space representing a letter in the word.

3. Click on the letters in the on-screen keyboard to guess a letter. If the guessed letter is correct, it will appear in its corresponding blank space. If the guessed letter is incorrect, a part of the hangman figure will be drawn.

4. Keep guessing letters until you either complete the word or make too many incorrect guesses (6 maximum).

5. If you complete the word within the maximum allowed incorrect guesses, you win! A victory message will be displayed.

6. If you use up all your incorrect guesses before completing the word, you lose. The correct word will be revealed.

7. You can choose to play again with a new word by clicking the "Play Again" button after a game ends.
